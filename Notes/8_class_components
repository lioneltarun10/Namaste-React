A functional component is a normal JS function.
Similarly , a class based component is a normal JS class.

To make a class based component , we need to extend our class to React.Component - 
class UserClass extends React.Component

We will have a render method inside the class component , which returns a piece of JSX.

To use props in class components , we have a constructor wehich will call super constructor passing props as argument.
 constructor(props){
        super(props)

        console.log(props);
    }


Using super constructor with props arguments basically allows accessing this.props in a Constructor function.

Now , how to use state variables inside class components.
Earlier their used to be no HOOk and functional components.
There's a different way of creating a state variable inside class component.

When we say we are loading a class component on webpage , it means we are creating an instance of that class.
Constructor is best place to create state variables.
We crate state variable inside class component in this way - 
constructor(props){
        super(props)
        this.state = {
            count: 0
        }
        
    }

 The state variable in the constructor is a big object which contains all the state variables.

 Even in functional components , even though we write different useState hook's for each state variable , behind the scenes all the state variables are stored inside one big state object.

 Now we want to update our state variables - 

 Never update the state variables directly in a class component
 i.e this.state.count = this.state.count +1  -> don't do this way  

 We get a setState function from React.Component , which takes the object where we need to update our state variables.
 i.e  this.setState({
                        count:this.state.count + 1,
                        count2: this.state.count2 +1
                    })

 This setState function will only update the state variables that we are giving as object in setState function , it will not touch other state variables in the this.state object.         

 Lifecycle of class based component - 

 when the class component loads , then a new instance of that class is created . the first thing that runs in the class is constructor , after it the render method is called.  
 This is the case when the parent component(About component) is functional component and the child component is class based component(UserClass)

 When both paraent and child components are class based, the lifecycle is -
 parent constructor
 parent render
 child constructor
 child render

 React also gives us another method in class components which is "componentDidMount"

 The lifecycle is -> constructor -> render method -> after our componet is loaded or mounted on the page then our componentDidMount method is called.

 So if both our parent and child has this componentDidmount methods , then lifecycle is - 

 parent constructor
 parent render
 child constructor
 child render - > child is mounted after this render call
 child componentDidMount - > parent component is still loading or did not mount on page
 parent componentDidMount -> parent component is mounted , then componentDidMount is called

 ComponentDidMount usecase -> to make API calls.
 But why?
 In functional component , we make api calls inside useEffect , because we load our component first onto the page , then useEffect will run inside which we make api call , then our component re-renders with new data on the page.

 Similarly , componentDidMount runs after our component is loaded(mounted) onto page , that's why we make api call in this method , so then our component re-renders again with the new data.

 Now , when we have 2 class components , it means we are having two instances of same class.

 * lifecycle when 2 child class components are inside parent class component - 
 We might think the below order is correct - 
- parent constructor
- parent render
  - first constructor
  - first render
  - first compoentDIdMount
  - second constructor
  - second render
  - second compoentDidMount
- parent componentDidMount 

This is wrong!!!!!!!!
The real order is -

- parent constructor
- parent render
  - first constructor
  - first render
  - second constructor
  - second render
  - first compoentDIdMount
  - second compoentDidMount
- parent componentDidMount 

The reason we can find from react life cyle diagram - 
website - https://projects.wojtekmaj.pl/react-lifecycle-methods-diagram/

React component mounting has 2 phases - 
render phase and commit phase
Render Phase - 
constructor is called, then render is called

then Commit Phase - 
React updates DOM and refs , then componentDidMount is called.
(That's why API calls are made in componentDidmount Phase)

That's why when there are multiple child components inside parent component , the react optimizes the rendering by batching the render phase of all child components together , after render phase is done for all child components , then the commit phase of all components is batched and started.

That is how it is rendering the components , but why is react doing in this order?

When we are loading a component , DOM manipulation is the most expensive process.
Render phase is very fast because in render phase React triggers reconciliation algorithm , it finds the diff betwwen the virtual dom's . But commit phase takes time , which is actual DOM manipulation.

That's why render phase is batched for all components and commit phase is batched for all components.
"That is why React is very FAST"

<Render Phase begins>
- parent constructor
- parent render
  - first constructor
  - first render
  - second constructor
  - second render
  <Render Phase ends>
  <Commit phase begins>
  <DOM UPDATED - IN SINGLE BATCH>
  - first compoentDIdMount
  - second compoentDidMount
- parent componentDidMount
<Commit phase ends> 

Making API calls - 

We can make componentDidMount method as async and we can make API call inside it.
i.e 
async componentDidMount(){
        //console.log(this.props.name + " child Component Did Mount");

        //API CALL
        const data = await fetch("https://api.github.com/users/lioneltarun10")
        const json = await data.json()

        console.log(json);
        this.setState({
            userInfo:json
        })
    }

LifeCycle - 

Mounting - 
first constructor of UserClass is called , then render is called , which renders our UI with dummy data or shimmer UI. 
Then componentDidMount is called , which makes API call , then we are updating our state variable with our api data.

Updating - 
When we update our state variables , React triggers render method again , then DOM manipulation takes place and we render our UI with updated Data.Then "componentDidUpdate" is called.

lifecycle - 
"Mounting "cycle starts
constructor(dummy data populated)
render(dummy)
webpage loaded with dummy data
componentDidMount is called
<api call>
this.setState -> state variable updated
"Mounting" cycle ends

"Update" cycle begins

render(api data)
website loaded with API data
componentDidUpdate is called

"Update" cycle ends

componentWillUnmount - 
when our component is unmounted from the webpage , then componentWillUnmount is called.
That is , when we go away from that page , componentWillUnmount is called.

Important!!
Never compare react life cycle method to Functional component.

useEffect() is not equal to componentDidMount().

Now,componentDidMount is called after initial render but componentDidUpdate is called after every subsequent render.
