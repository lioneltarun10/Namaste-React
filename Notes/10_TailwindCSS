First way of writing css is normal CSS. Like we did in our app.
second way is SASS. 
But these 2 ways are not recommened wasy for writing CSS for big large sale applications.

Third way is Styled components.
We can choose this with react application.

Material UI , bootstrap , chakra UI , Ant Design - These are some UI frameworks which we can use.

Fourth way - Tailwind CSS.

Tailwind CSS

npm install -D tailwindcss postcss
npx tailwindcss init

postcss is a tool for transforming css with javascript. Tailwindcss uses postcss behind the scenes.

npx tailwindcss init created a tailwind.config.js configuration file for tailwind.

we need to create a configuration file for postcss also.We do it manually as shown in tailwind css website for parcel.
Copy text in tailwindcss website and paste in config file of postcss.

Important!!
Tailwind offers classname automatically for every css we want to write in our app.

Install Tailwind css Intellisense - one of best vscode extensions for taiwind.

If we want to have a specific width like 200px , but suppose there's no class provided by tailwind for it. Then we can do it int he following way - 
 className="m-4 p-4 w-[200px]" 

 Same applies for other properties like height,etc.

 Pros of tailwindcss - 
 - no need to move between files ot write css.
 - initial learning curve will be there , but after that we remember things and writing css becomes very very easy
 - Tailwindcss is very light weight
   - Parcel will only import the css which is used in our app , even though tailwindcss has thousands of classes.
   - suppose m-4 class is used many times in code , but we will import m-4 only once , and suppose shadow class is not used at all , we do not import it at all. That's why taiwindcss is very light.
- we can build complex UI.   

 COns of tailwindcss -
 - If we want to apply lot of css to a class , it will make our code look ugly.
 - Code becomes little less readable for very long css classes on an element.
