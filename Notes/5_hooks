If we keeps our components in a seperate folder , we need to export them and import in our app.js file and use it.

Never keep hardcoded data and URL links in component files. Keep them in seperate folder like utils or common.

There are 2 types of import and export.

EXPROT - default export and named export.

We cannot have multiple default exports in a file.
When we want onl one thing to export in a file , we use dafault export.

If we want to export multiple things in a file , we use named export.

IMPORT - when we have named export , we need to have {} braces in import and a default export doesn't need {} braces in import.

We can use named export and default export at once on same component , it won't create a problem.

React is faster because it can do faster DOM manipulation , efficient DOM manipulation , Virtual DOM , Diff Algorithm.
React is only good at DOM operations.

React Hooks
Hook is a normal JS function given to us by React.

Whenevr a state variable changes , React re-renders the component.
React keeps the data layer in sync with the UI layer.

React uses - 
Reconciliation Algorithm (React Fiber)

Virtual DOM is a representation of actual DOM.
Virtaul DOM is nothing but a JS object which represents ACTUAL DOM.

Diff Algorithm - It finds the difference between the one virtual DOM and the updated Virtual DOM.

Suppose there are 7 restaurants and on click of button we want to filter them based on rating .
So suppose after filtering , 3 restaurants are left.

Diff algo will calculate the difference between old virtual DOM and updated virtual DOM(generated on click of button) , which is 4 nodes(restaurants) and then it updates the actual DOM on every render cycle.

Finding out the diff between 2 HTMl is difficult , but finding difference b/w 2 objects is easy.

REACT DOES EFFICIENT DOM MANIPULATION BECAUSE IT HAS VIRTUAL DOM , A DIFF ALGORITHM WHICH IS VERY EFFICIENT IN DOM MANIPULATION.

When we call setState , it triggers the diff algorithm and we get updated UI. State variables are a way for react to key a track of data , and when we set it to new data , react runs diff algo and we get updated UI.

we can also write state variables as - 
const arr = useState(resList);

  const [listOfRestaurants,setListOfRestaurants] =arr;

  because useState returns an array , and we are just destructuring it.

  We can also write as
const arr = useState(resList);

const listOfRestaurants = arr[0]
const setListOfRestaurants = arr[1]

These are just basic concepts of JS arrays.
