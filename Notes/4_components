Components are just like functions so that we can reuse them again and again.
In JSX , when we give inline css , it's given inside a JS object.
To use javascript inside JSX , we need to use JS in between {} braces.
That's why if we create a styleCard object , with css properties , to give it to an element in JSX , give as below
<div className="res-card" style={styleCard}>

For Inline css , we arite as below
<div className="res-card" style={{
      backgroundColor:'#f0f0f0'
    }}>
The first {} braces indicate , we are going to write JS inside it , the second {} braces indicates a JS object.

Props is short form for properties.
If we want to pass data dynamically to a component , we can pass it through props.
Props are just normal argumants to a function.
Passing a prop to a component is nothing but passing an argument to a function.
Prop is a JS Object.
We can also destructure the props on the fly.
i.e const RestaurantCard = (props) is same as
const RestaurantCard = ({resName,cuisine})


Config driven UI
When website UI is driven by Config (data), which comes from backend.
i.e- Different UI for swiggy in delhi and bangalore.  

When looping with for loops or Map or any other loops , we alwasy need to give unique keys to the components , otherwise the app will take a big performance hit , by unique key , the app will be optimized.
Reason for this is , suppose there are 5 components at same level as child of some parent component in the HTML tree, if we want to add new component 

Without unique key Situation - React doesn't know which component is new , so it cleans all components and re-renders all components along with new component.

With Unique key Situation - React know which component is new , and it only renders the new component this time , and previous components need not be re-rendered.
i.e resList.map((restaurant) => (
            <RestaurantCard key={restaurant.data.id} resData={restaurant}/>
            ))

Due to which the performance is optimized.

Sometimes developers use Index of map as key to the components. which is not recommened by the official Reacts docs.
i.e  resList.map((restaurant,index) => (
            <RestaurantCard key={index} resData={restaurant}/>
            ))

Not using keys (not acceptable) <<< index as key <<< unique id (best practice)
